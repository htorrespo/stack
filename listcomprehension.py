# A list comprehension is a syntactic construct available in some programming languages 
# for creating a list based on existing lists.

# The basic syntax is
# [ expression for item in list if conditional ]

# This is equivalent to:
# for item in list:
#    if conditional:
#        expression

# new_list = [expression(i) for i in old_list if filter(i)]
